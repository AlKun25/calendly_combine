"""Overlap engine for finding common availability across calendars.

This module provides functionality to identify overlapping time slots
across multiple calendar schedules. It implements an efficient algorithm 
to process time slots from different calendars and find common availability.

The overlap processor normalizes all time slots to UTC to ensure accurate
comparisons across different timezones, and implements an O(n log n) algorithm
for finding overlaps.
